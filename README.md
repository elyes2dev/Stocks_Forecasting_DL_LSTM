## Overview

This project focuses on forecasting Microsoft stock prices using deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The goal is to develop a robust model that accurately predicts future stock prices based on historical data.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Collection:** Gathered historical Microsoft stock price data from reliable.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Conducted data preprocessing tasks including cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.
- **Model Development:** Implemented LSTM networks using TensorFlow or PyTorch to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in the stock price data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the performance of the LSTM model using metrics.
- **Visualization:** Visualized the model's predictions compared to actual stock prices using plots and charts to analyze the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab** (for development)
